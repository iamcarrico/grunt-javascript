# Simple JavaScript Linter and Minfier

Here is a simple JavaScript linter and minfier to quickly run all your code through grunt.js.

## Installation

Install grunt.js
```
npm install -g gruntcli
```

Then install all required node packages with:

```
npm install
```

## To Use

Put all of your JavaScript files into js-src folder, then run 'grunt watch' if you want to watch your assests. Or 'grunt js' to lint then minimize all the js files within the js-src folder.

## Tech
